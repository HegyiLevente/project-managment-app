# Project Managment Application

 A spring mvc application built with spring-boot implementing spring security in the backend and thymeleaf in the front end where you can create projects, employees, assign employees to projects and vice versa if you have the corresponding ADMIN role. Otherwise you can view them. 
 To see all the pages you need to register first and login then, having by default a simple USER role. All the data is backed in a postgresql database.
